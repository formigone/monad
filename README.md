SETTING UP A LOCAL SERVER
-------------------------

From a terminal, navigate to /api and:

```
    composer install
    php5 -S localhost:8080
```

This will start a local PHP server on ```localhost``` port ```8080```. This way you can access the backend API
at ```http://localhost:8080/...```.

To test your set up, go to ```http://localhost:8080/index/```

***You may need to delete a couple of ```require``` or ```include``` statements from the zf1 project inside vendors
